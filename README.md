# EGFWD-LED-CONTROL
LED control embedded Tiva C project
Control blinking of an LED for a user-defined ON and OFF periods Create a function in the App layer that takes as an input from the user a specific ON time and OFF time in seconds, lights a LED for the given ON time, and dim it for the given OFF time. Itâ€™s prohibited to use predefined delay functions, only timer driver functions can be used. 


Implement the GPIO driver
1-Create the GPIO driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files.
2-Create functions in GPIO driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality Provide a screen recording of GPIO driver, explaining its functions and Macros, and how each function will help to achieve the functionality of the project 

Implement Timer driver
1-Create the Timer driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files 
2-Create functions in Timer driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality 
3-Creating a Timer Overflow ISR that performs the required functionality Passing the ISR as a callback function from App Layer to Timer driver in MCAL layer Provide a screen recording of TIMER driver, explaining its functions and Macros, and how each function will help to achieve the functionality of the project 

Implement interrupt driver
1-Creating the Interrupt driver from scratch using the sufficient interface,configure,private and program files 
2-Create functions in Interrupt driver that are needed to perform the required project functionality Provide a screen recording of Interrupt driver, explaining its functions and Macros, and how each function will help to achieve the functionality of the project
